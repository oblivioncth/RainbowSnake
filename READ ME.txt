The program contained in this archeive is a new take on an old classic: Rainbow Snake.
It plays exactly like the original snake, but uses multiple colors instead of one and allows
the player to utilize new game mechanics based on these colors. The primary two is that you can
loop around the screen by going into a the wall that is the same color as the snake head, and you
can also pass through the snake body itself if you can manage to line up the snake head with another
snake block that is the same color (very hard to do). The secondary difference is that there are
three power-ups added that also add to the gameplay. You can have up to three at once and they are
used in a FILO order.

Power-Ups
=========
1) Match Head - Changes the snake head to match the color of the wall it is facing
2) Match Wall - Rotates the walls so that the wall the snake is facing becomes the same color as the head
3) Time Stretch - Makes the game run at 1/4th speed for the next 20 moves

Controls
========
Arrow Keys - Set snake direction
Space - Activate top power-ups

Since I programmed this using the Qt C++ libraries and Qt creator, I have included pre-compiled binaries
so you have an easy way to inspect the game
